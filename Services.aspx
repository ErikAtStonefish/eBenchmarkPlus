                At eBenchmarkPlus, our primary business is Utility Tracking & Benchmarking buildings in the greater Los Angeles Area. 
                We utilize the EPA’s ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager® software and perform a preliminary on-site audit as now required 
                by CA AB 802 and the City of Los Angeles Ordinance #184674 (starting in 2017).

                eBenchmarkPlus also conducts ASHRAE Level Ⅰ audits which allows us to assist building owners and managers to find 
                those “no-cost” or “low-cost” energy savings opportunities.
