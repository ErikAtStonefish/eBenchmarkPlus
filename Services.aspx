                At eBenchmarkPlus, our primary business is Utility Tracking & Benchmarking buildings in the greater Los Angeles Area. 
                We utilize the EPA’s <b>ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager®</b> software and perform a preliminary on-site audit.

                The City of Los Angeles recently passed <b class="text-success">Ordinance #184674</b>, known as the <b class="text-success">Existing Building Energy and Water Efficiency</b> program or 
                <b class="text-success">EBEWE</b>. The first group of buildings are required to comply by July 1st, 2017. In addition, the State of California passed 
                <b class="text-success">AB 802</b> with similar requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your building(s) may be eligible for ENERGY STAR® certification. Buildings that score 75 and better will be exempt from ASHRAE Level II and
                retro-commissioning (RCx) requirements. Buildings are also exempt when a 15% reduction in energy and 20% reduction in water usage for each reporting period is documented. 
                ASHRAE Level II &amp; RCx compliance starts in January, 2019.

                those “no-cost” or “low-cost” energy savings opportunities.
