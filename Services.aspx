                At eBenchmark Plus, our primary business is Utility Tracking & Benchmarking buildings in the greater Los Angeles Area. 
                We utilize the <strong>EPA</strong>’s <b>ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager®</b> software and perform a preliminary on-site audit.
            </p>

            <p>
                The City of Los Angeles recently passed <b class="text-success">Ordinances #184674 and #185198</b>, known as the 
                <b class="text-success">Existing Building Energy and Water Efficiency</b> program or <b class="text-success">EBEWE</b>. The first group of 
                buildings are required to comply by December 1st, 2017 (extended from July 1st, 2017). In addition, the State of California passed 
                <b class="text-success">AB 802</b> with similar requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your building(s) may be eligible for ENERGY STAR® certification. Buildings that score 75 and better will be exempt from retro-commissioning (RCx) 
                requirements. RCx compliance starts in January, 2019. A facility that documents 15% energy reduction and 20% water reduction can choose not to perform RCx services.
            </p>

            <p>
                eBenchmark Plus also conducts preliminary on-site and ASHRAE Level Ⅰ audits which allows us to assist building owners and managers to find 
                those “no-cost” or “low-cost” energy savings opportunities.
