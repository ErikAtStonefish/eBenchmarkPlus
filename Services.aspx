                At eBenchmarkPlus, our primary business is Utility Tracking & Benchmarking buildings in the greater Los Angeles Area. 
                We utilize the EPA’s ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager® software and perform a preliminary on-site audit as now required 
                by CA AB 802 and the City of Los Angeles Ordinance #184674 (starting in 2017).
            </p>

            <p>
                Your building(s) may be eligible for ENERGY STAR® certification. Buildings that score 75 and better will be exempt from retro-commissioning (RCx) and
                ASHRAE Level II requirements. RCx &amp; ASHRAE Level II compliance starts in January, 2019.
            </p>

            <p>
                eBenchmarkPlus also conducts preliminary on-site and ASHRAE Level Ⅰ audits which allows us to assist building owners and managers to find 
                those “no-cost” or “low-cost” energy savings opportunities.
            </p>
